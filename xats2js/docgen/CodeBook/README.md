## [Doublet](./Doublet/2020-11-29)

An implementation is given of Doublet, a word game invented by Lewis
Carroll (1832-1898), the author of children's classics "Alice in Wonderland".
This example shows a typical approach to graph-based breadth-first search that
is based on the gtree library (which provides templates for enumerating a graph
lazily in various fashions (e.g., depth-first and breadth-first).
