The examples presented in this directory aim at showing how things are typically
done when ATS3 is used in co-programming with JavaScript (and various related tools).

## [Hello](https://github.com/xanadu-lang/xats2js/tree/master/docgen/CodeBook/Hello)

This is a short introductory example that explains a few basics in co-programming
with ATS3 + JavaScript.

## [Doublet](https://github.com/xanadu-lang/xats2js/tree/master/docgen/CodeBook/Doublet)

An implementation is given of Doublet, a word game invented by Lewis
Carroll (1832-1898), the author of children's classics "Alice in Wonderland".
This example shows a typical approach to graph-based breadth-first search that
is based on the gtree library (which provides templates for enumerating a graph
lazily in various fashions (e.g., depth-first and breadth-first).
